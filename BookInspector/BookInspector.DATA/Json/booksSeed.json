    "description": "Build web applications in Microsoft .NET that run in any modern browser, helping you to transfer your .NET experience and skills to a new environment and build browser-based applications using a robust and type-safe language and runtime. Developing a web site with rich client-side behavior means most developers need to learn a transpiled language like JavaScript or TypeScript. But today you can also develop rich browser applications using the .NET runtime and C# using Blazor. With Blazor you can use all that experience you have amassed over the years, and can use thousands of already existing libraries, right in the browser. Blazor Revealed will allow you to create a rich web site experience in no time. You will learn how to build user interfaces, and present data to a user for display and modification, capturing the user’s changes via data binding. The book shows you how to access a rich library of .NET functionality such as a component model for building a composable user interface, including how to develop reusable components that can be used across many pages and web sites. Also covered is data exchange with a server, giving you access to microservices and database services. Blazor provides a fresh take on web development by eliminating the need for you to learn different languages and frameworks for client- and server-side development. Blazor allows C# and .NET to be used on all sides, providing a robust feature set that is well suited toward scalable, enterprise-level applications. Blazor Revealed gets you started in using this important new toolkit for web application development. What You'll Learn Build user interfaces and display data for users to edit Capture the user’s changes via data binding Transfer data back and forth between server and client Communicate with microservices and database services Develop reusable components and assemble them into bigger components Use routing to build single page applications (SPAs) Build Blazor libraries that are reusable across applications Who This Book Is For Experienced .NET developers who want to apply their existing skills to building professional quality, client-side web applications that run in any browser. The book is for web developers who want to step away from JavaScript and its complexities, and instead use a proven technology (.NET) that is robust toward creating enterprise-quality applications that scale and are reliable and that provide good user experience. The book is for intermediate to advanced .NET web developers with no experience using Blazor.",

    "description": "Design, develop, build, and deploy an end-to-end serverless architecture by leveraging Azure services, frameworks, and tools. This book offers a holistic approach, guiding you through the design and development of a Twitter Bot application, while leveraging Azure Functions. Integrating Serverless Architecture begins with an overview of serverless computing and getting started with Azure Functions. Here, you will create a Twitter bot function which scans Twitter for the latest tweets and makes use of dependency injection. Further, you will learn about Azure Cosmos DB where you will cover its change feed mechanism and the repository pattern. You will create a Cosmos DB trigger-based tweet notifier function, which will broadcast the latest tweets to connected clients. You will explore the basics of Azure Service Bus and create a tweet scheduler function, which will prioritize different keywords for the Twitter bot function. Along the way, you will debug, deploy, and test the functions in the Azure environment. This book shows you how to secure your Azure Function secrets with the help of Azure Key Vault. To further your understanding of the technology, you will learn logging and exception handling in Azure Functions. Later in the book, you will build a Twitter bot web application by using ASP.NET Core and Materialize CSS, which will interact with several HTTP-based Azure Functions. The Twitter bot web application allows users to log in through the Twitter Identity Provider, subscribe to different keywords/hashtags, and browse the latest tweets based on subscriptions. You will get started with SignalR Service and integrate it with Azure Functions and web applications. Towards the end you will go through app service authentication on Azure Functions and discover how to configure continuous integration and deployment to Azure Functions. After reading this book, you will be able to understand the steps involved in design, development, and deployment of a workflow using Azure Functions. What You Will Learn Design and develop a Twitter bot application using Azure Functions with Azure Web App Service as the front end Leverage Azure Cosmos DB as data storage and trigger notifications using its change feed mechanism Store and retrieve secrets from Azure Key Vault Integrate Azure Functions with Azure SignalR Service to broadcast real-time messages Secure Azure Functions by enabling Twitter identity authentication using built-in App Service authentication Build a continuous integration and continuous deployment pipeline for Azure Functions using Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) Who This Book Is For Developers, software engineers, and architects who design and manage infrastructures and build applications by leveraging Microsoft cloud services.",

Among the many specific issues and topics that arise in the course of the discussion are the following: - problems of transparency and conflict of interest; - the recent growth in IIAs between and among developing nations; - the effect of new model bilateral investment treaties (BITs); - the ability of non-disputing parties to participate in investor-state arbitration; - theories of the interaction of foreign direct investment (FDI) and BITs; - investor-state arbitration as an evasion of public regulatory authority; - the role of investment funds in international investment; - 'fork in the road' provisions; and - institutional versus ad hoc arbitration. International business and other investors will greatly appreciate the in-depth information and insightful guidance in this solidly useful book. It will also be welcomed by jurists and students as a significant milestone in the development of principles in a quickly growing field of practice that is still plagued with inconsistencies.",

It assesses the role of multinational corporations in making foreign investments, and considers ways in which misconduct on the part of such corporations in host states could be controlled. Focusing on the protection of foreign investment and its associated problems, Sornarajah explores treaty-based methods, and examines several bilateral and regional investment treaties. He takes account not only of the law, but also of the relevant literature in economics, political science and other associated disciplines.",

While theoretical growth models developed in the economics literature, make no distinction between private, and public components of investment, there is an emerging appreciation that private investment is more efficient, and productive tan public investment. Results from the recent empirical literature, updated here with the recent data on private investment, suggest that private investment has a stronger association with long run economic growth than public investment. The second part shows trends in private, and public fixed investment in fifty developing countries. On average, the ratio of private investment to GDP continued its upward trend, reaching record levels in 1998, the most recent year for which comparable data exist. That year, average private investment reached 14.3 percent of GDP, but public investment, fell to only 7.0 percent of GDP, its lowest level since 1974.",

    "description": "The Investment Treaty Forum of the British Institute of International and Comparative Law brings together eminent practitioners, arbitrators, and academics in the dynamic area of international investment law. Members of the Forum, under the British Institute's auspices, examine and debate the legal and policy issues presented by the increasingly complex web of investment treaties and the disputes that arise under them. The Forum held two conferences in 2007: the present volume compiles the papers presented at the conferences as well as a transcript of the round-table discussion on the subject of 'precedent' in international investment arbitration that featured some of the foremost authorities on the subject. Part I of the book is devoted to remedies, compensation and valuation in international investment disputes. This under-theorized area of law is ripe for further exploration by lawyers and economists, and the papers in this volume present a framework for further inquiry. Papers in Part II address the jurisprudence emerging from investment arbitration tribunals on issues such as fair and equitable treatment, 'umbrella' clauses, and nationality of claimants. The overarching question addressed by the papers, and by the concluding roundtable, is the relationship of those decisions with general international law and whether or not there is, or should be, a doctrine of precedent in investment treaty arbitration.",

The evidence for taking corrective action is now more compelling than ever. This report draws on case studies and other evidence to show how public policy can and should support services and infrastructure where the social returns are the highest and the use by women the greatest. It reviews progress made to date on gender issues and explores why inequalities persist. The report also stimulates ideas for creative solutions by pointing out innovative and less-than-obvious strategies that have proved successful. In Morocco, for instance, a study shows that paving the public road to school increases a girl's probability of attending classes by 40 percent.

Dolzer and Stevens show that a great degree of uniformity exists in modern investment treaties and thus clearly establish that the significance of these treaties lies not only in the extensive network of rights and obligations of their respective parties; equally important is the contribution of these treaties to an emerging international acceptance of common standards for the treatment of foreign investment. This book presents all the elements of modern BITs and explains what the main problems are. Based on research that has never been published elsewhere, it offers a valuable contribution to the understanding of an area of international law that is currently undergoing tremendous change.'

    "description": "Private investment in developing countries continued its upward trend in 1996, the most recent year for which data exist, on an unweighted average basis. Public investment rates continued a decline that began in the early 1980s. The largest increases in private investment between 1995 and 1996 occurred in Malawi, Mauritania, Benin, Papua New Guinea, and Bolivia, suggesting that the private firms in some of the world's poorest countries are showing a strong supply response. This year's edition includes statistics for four major Organization for Economic Co-operation & Development (OECD) countries for comparison with developing country trends. It also includes a discussion of domestic capital markets in financing private investment; even though stock and bond markets have grown at a rapid rate, they play only a minor role in financing investment in the developing countries where banks are a more important source of financing.",

    "description": "The paper provides a systematic analysis of bilateral, source and host factors driving portfolio equity investment across countries, using newly-released data on international equity holdings at the end of 2001. It develops a model that links bilateral equity holdings to bilateral trade in goods and services and finds that the data strongly support such a correlation. Larger bilateral positions are also associated with proxies for informational proximity. It further documents that the scale of aggregate foreign equity asset and liability holdings is larger for richer countries and countries with more developed stock markets.",

    "description": "It's a new world out there. This completely revised and updated edition will show Canadians how to survive and thrive in uncertain and volatile markets. The new edition includes performance analysis on more than 100 newly established ETFs. Exchange traded funds have been called the next generation of mutual funds. Some advocates even believe ETFs will overtake mutual funds as surely as CDs made LPs obsolete. In 2000 there were 30 ETFs trading on North American stock exchanges with assets of $36.5 billion. Today there are more 100 ETFs being traded with assets of more than $75 billion. Analysts predict that within the next five years the number of ETFs will skyrocket, holding assets in excess of $1 trillion. The New Investment Frontier is the first book that will guide Canadians through the bewildering world of ETF investments. It not only discusses the various Canadian and American ETFs available, but it also examines the different tax considerations for Canadians buying American ETFs and RRSP restrictions. Although they are not yet numerous on Canadian exchanges today, ETFs are a growing and significant market presence. The largest Canadian ETF is the i60 Fund which was the fifth-most-traded stock on the TSE. The New Investment Frontier will prepare Canadians to take part in the cutting edge of international investment.",

    "description": "The Energy Charter Treaty, initiated by the 1991 European Energy Charter and completed in December 1994, is an innovative major multilateral investment and trade treaty. The book has an introduction by Ruud Lubbers who, as the Dutch Prime Minister, played the key role in initiating the Energy Charter negotiations. It brings together contributions on the energy/investment background, the geopolitical context, the Energy Charter negotiations and the relevant specific topics of the Treaty (focusing on investment and trade, but also environment, competition and transit) by the key specialists on the subject, ranging from countries such as the US (which in the end decided not to join the Treaty) to Russia and Kazakhstan, including energy and investment specialists, international investment and commercial lawyers and arbitrators. The contributors include noted international energy/economic law authorities, but also key participants and observers of the Treaty negotiations. This book is intended to provide the first authoritative analysis of the background, negotiations and content of the Energy Charter Treaty and to provide support and guidance for subsequent negotiations and the difficult challenges involved in interpretation and application of the Treaty. It will be an essential tool for anybody working with the Energy Charter Treaty. The book contains in its annex the major documents of the Treaty: The 1991 European Energy Charter, the 1994 Treaty and its relevant Protocols, Annexes, Understandings and Final Act Declarations.",

    "description": "This book consists of detailed case studies of foreign direct investment (FDI) in China, India, Ireland, Malaysia, Mexico and Sub-Saharan Africa, providing a critical review of the determinants and impact of FDI on growth and development, employment, technology transfer and trade. The expert contributors examine a range of controversial issues including the contribution of the relatively large volume of FDI in China to its growth, whether India should fully liberalise its FDI regime and the impact of Mexico's membership of NAFTA on the volume of FDI it has attracted. Malaysia's economic policies, which appear to have attracted relatively large volumes of FDI but failed to generate the hoped for transmission of technology and skills are also questioned, along with the role of corruption in limiting the contribution of FDI to achieving social goals in Sub-Saharan Africa. The impressive record of the Irish Republic in attracting and harnessing FDI to development objectives is examined closely and provides a detailed analysis of policies likely to promote efficient utilisation of FDI.",

    "description": "The SRI phenomenon is said to be entering the mainstream of financial intermediation. From a fairly marginal practice promoted or campaigned for by NGO’s and at odds with financial practice and orthodoxy it grew into well formulated policy adopted by a wide range of investors. Academic literature on SRI has also boomed on the assumption that mainstreaming is taking place. However, little thinking has been carried out on questions specifically arising from this alleged ‘mainstreaming’. This book, addressed to those with a scholarly or practitioner’s interest in SRI, starts filling this neglected dimension. Today, one cannot ignore the difficulties of main stream financing. The financial spheres are trembling globally in one of the worst crises since the 1930’s. As a response to the crisis, the intermediation of ‘financial responsibility’ will undoubtedly be the subject of new regulation and scrutinizing. This book looks into what these turbulences will imply for SRI. In view of these circumstances, one might or even should, ask oneself whether the phenomenon was not an empty fad during the exuberant high of financial euphoria that came abruptly to an end with current financial crises. To put it rather sec: are financial intermediaries that promote ‘sustainability’ credible, while it is obvious that some developments in financial intermediation -predictably, as some say- were unsustainable? Is this an opportunity for enhancing SRI because of the strength and superiority it has developed or will it disappear due to a return to financial myopia? This book is the first to question the future of SRI in such a radical way.",

    "description": "From a historical point of view, the main activity of investment banks is what today we call security underwriting. Investment banks buy securities, such as bonds and stocks, from an issuer and then sell them to the ?nal investors. In the eighteenth century, the main securities were bonds issued by governments. The way these bonds were priced and placed is extraordinarily similar to the system that inve- ment banks still use nowadays. When a government wanted to issue new bonds, it negotiated with a few prominent “middlemen” (today we would call them investment bankers). The middlemen agreed to take a fraction of the bonds: they accepted to do so only after having canvassed a list of people they could rely upon. The people on the list were the ?nal investors. The middlemen negotiated with the government even after the issuance. Indeed, in those days governments often changed unilaterally the bond conditions and being on the list of an important middleman could make the difference. On the other hand, middlemen with larger lists were considered to be in a better bargaining position. This game was repeated over time, and hence, reputation mattered. For the middlemen, being trusted by both the investors on the list and by the issuing governments was crucial.",

    "description": "This work deals with the current state of investment dispute resolution and analyzes the problems associated with investor-state arbitration. The author examines developments in the existing legal framework and looks at the mechanisms under existing domestic and international systems â?? such as judicial review and class actions â?? to see if these can be applied to investment dispute resolution. The author concludes that the features of traditional arbitration are not flexible enough to meet the needs of this modern form of international dispute resolution. Investment arbitration is now entering a new phase of its development. The traditional, typically arbitration-related issues of consent, privity, and confidentiality are making room for the now more important questions of disclosure, transparency, legal certainty, and consistency. The author calls for setting up a \"model procedure,\" specifically created for international investment disputes as this would enable the establishment of a \"tailor-made\" process for this ever-growing area of law.",

It provides insights into the question of whether EU enlargement will have consequences for capital flows into those countries. Since the start of European monetary union, the discussion on cross-border mergers in the European banking industry has intensified. The final part of the book contains contributions to this debate.",

    "description": "\" \"Draconian\" regulations have created distortions in asset management, limited opportunities for diversification, and, as a consequence have hampered, the performance of pension funds.\" This volume shows that the return to retirement assets, expected replacement rates, and, hence, the net welfare gain from pension reform is lower under a draconian regulatory framework than under a more liberal pension fund investment regime. Important policy conclusions of the paper are that existing regulatory regimes should be liberalized as soon as possible to allow pension fund investments in a wider array of financial instruments and that regulations should require evaluation of pension fund performance against market benchmarks as opposed to exclusive focus on comparisons with industry averages. The paper also suggests a review of the current structure of the private pension fund industry in Latin America and an evaluation against alternatives in the light of actual performance experience.",
